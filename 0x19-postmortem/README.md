# E-commerce Platform Login Issue - Readme

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** The login issue persisted from June 1, 2024, at 8:00 AM UTC to June 3, 2024, at 10:00 AM UTC.
  
- **Impact:** Users encountered significant delays and were unable to log in to the e-commerce platform, resulting in a loss of potential sales and frustration among customers.

- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the login issue was identified as database query optimization problems, leading to prolonged response times and timeouts during the login process.

## Timeline

- **Detection:** June 1, 2024, 8:15 AM UTC. Customers reported login failures and slow loading times.
  
- **Investigation:** With no dedicated engineering team, I began investigating the issue with assistance from friends experienced in web development. We initially suspected server overload but discovered database queries were the bottleneck after reviewing server logs and performance metrics.
  
- **Escalation:** As the sole individual responsible, I escalated the issue to my network of peers for additional assistance and guidance.
  
- **Resolution:** Collaboratively, we implemented database query optimization techniques and caching mechanisms to improve query performance and reduce login response times.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause Explanation:** The root cause of the login issue was identified as inefficient database queries, exacerbated by high query complexity and lack of proper indexing.
  
- **Resolution Details:** To address the root cause, we optimized database queries by restructuring them, adding appropriate indexes, and optimizing the database schema. Additionally, we implemented caching mechanisms to reduce the frequency of database queries and alleviate load during peak usage periods.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Regularly audit database queries to identify and address potential bottlenecks.
  - Implement query optimization best practices, such as index optimization and query rewriting.
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect anomalies in database performance and query latency.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Conduct a comprehensive review of all database queries used in the login process to identify inefficient queries.
  2. Optimize the database schema and indexing strategies to improve query performance and reduce latency.
  3. Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the frequency of database queries and improve overall system responsiveness during peak usage periods.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to mitigate the risk of similar login issues in the future and ensure a seamless user experience on our e-commerce platform, even with limited resources.
